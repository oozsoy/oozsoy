Welcome to my github profile! I am a [Juan de la Cierva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_de_la_Cierva) Research Fellow at the Institute of Theoretical Physics, Madrid. 

My research thus far is leaned towards the intersection of particle physics and cosmology. In this context, I am broadly interested in the time evolution of particles (Quantum Fields) in the early universe and the impact this dynamics may impart on the cosmological observables, to shed some light on fundamental constitiuents of the cosmos. From a more practical perspective, I am trying to build robust mathematical models that make interesting predictions and looking new ways to test these models through experimental probes. Some of the exciting topics that I explored in this context include supersymmetry, dark matter, inflation and gravitational waves.

Recently, my explorations on stocahstic dynamics of fields in the early universe have made me develop an interest in the analogue sysmtem studied in Quantitative Finance. 
On the other hand, as per my interest in predicting things, I have been recently exploring Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. A particular venue that I am curios about in this context is analyzing and understanding time ordered data: time-series analysis and forecasting methods with learning algorithms. 

I occasionally discuss topics that I find interesting in Statistics, Mathematical Finance and ML in my [blog](https://oozsoy.github.io/). I will also share some of the projects that I have been developing there.
