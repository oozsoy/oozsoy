Welcome to my GitHub page ðŸ‘‹,

I am a physicist with a strong interest in data analytics, mathematical modeling, and their applications in finance and machine learning.

Research via: [inspire-hep](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1297330?ui-citation-summary=true)

I occasionally discuss topics I find interesting in statistics, mathematical finance, and machine learning in my [blog](https://oozsoy.github.io/).  
I also share some of the projects Iâ€™ve been working on there.

Thanks for visiting!
